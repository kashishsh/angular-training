- While building reactive forms, we need to create formControl object explicitly in the code.
- In Angular, AbsctactControl class is the base class for formControl and formGroup. All properties common in FG and FC are defined in abstractControl class.
- All the directives required in reactive forms are defined inside ReactiveFormsModule which we need to add in app.module.ts file in imports array.

- In reactive forms, instead of using HTML5 attributes, we assign validators while creating formControl object.
- In Angular, we have a Validator class which can be imported from @angular/forms.

- In angular we have a class called FormControl. For each input in our form, we need to create instance of FormControl class. With this control class we can :
  1. Check value of the field
  2. find if touched / untouched
  3. find dirty / pristine
  4. find valid or not
  5. Validation erros

- Similar to FormControl class, we have a FormGroup class, which represents a group of controls in the form. Each form is essentially a control group. All controls of FormControl are available with FormGroup also.

- There are two ways to create controls:
  1. Directives : Angular will create control objects for us implicitly under the hood. also called template driven forms as they are build using the template.
  2. Code : Explicitly creating the control objects. In our component we should write code to create controls. Also called Reactive forms.

- Reactive forms:
  1. More control over validation logic.
  2. Good for complex forms.
  3. Unit testable.

- Template drive forms:
  1. Good for simpler forms.
  2. Simple validation.
  3. Easier to create.
  4. Less code.

- ngModel in template driven forms :
  -- We apply ngModel directive to input, and angular will create a control object and associate it with that input field and bind it to a property in component.
  -- syntax: [(ngModel)]="name"
  -- We need to have the name attribute set for an input to use ngModel, which helps angular to distinguish between the form-controls.

- Angular by default applies ngForm directive to all forms. ngForm also have all properties like touched, untouched, valid, invalid etc. ngForm.value contains the value of form in json format.

- When we apply ngModel directive to an input, Angular automatically creates a form control object and associates that with that input field.
- Angular automatically apply ngForm directive to your forms and it will internally create a formGroup object and associate it with the form. We can optionally apply ngModelGroup to groups in the form. It will also create a formGroup object for that group.
- ngForm have output property submit to submit the form while ngModelGroup doesn't have that property.
